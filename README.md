# Portfolio Optimization Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a research project that explores the use of machine learning techniques — including XGBoost, GARCH, and Hierarchical Clustering — for optimizing portfolios using Nifty 50 stock data from 2014 to 2023.

## Contents

- `portfolio_optimization.ipynb`: Python notebook with all analysis and model code.
- `Report.docx`: Full research paper including methodology and results.
- Data: Extracted from Yahoo Finance.

## Techniques Used

- Mean-Variance Optimization
- XGBoost
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
- GARCH Model
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- HRP Asset Allocation

## Results

- Five different portfolio strategies
- Risk/return metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, CVaR)
- Best-performing strategy: HRP with clustering-based stock selection
